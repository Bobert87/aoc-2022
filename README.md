# Advent of Code 2022

This is, as always, an attempt to stay sharp in programming by joning this Christmas themed challenge. You can [read more about aoc here](https://adventofcode.com/).

I originally set myself to try and do it in a different languate each year but so far I have only done in Java and javascript. Instead of trying the bare minimum in each languate it served like an exercise to learn and test tools for my IDE, testing frameworks, linters and so on.

### How to use
- Download the repo.
- From the terminal run `npm install` on the root folder.
- If you have the jest extension, you will see all the tests on the testing window, else you can go into every problem and check the unit tests.
- The `problemTemplate` folder already contains the structure for file parsing and unit testing, copy it for new problems.

### Tools

I recommend to use this tools to have a similar experience as I had developing it.

- Visual Studio Code
- Jest Extension
- Prettier extension
- ESLint
